## INTODUCTION

SPIT AWAY is a short 2D game about alpacas spitting each other. The player takes the role of the brown alpaca and plays against the white one, who spits back using a simple AI. There are three types of saliva: normal, fire, and venom; each of them has a different impact range, weight, and damange inflicted. The player and enemy both start off with normal saliva, but potion pickups will randomly appear. 

The turns alternate between the player and the enemy, with a time of 20 seconds to act, and the scenario tiles are destructible. Follow this link to play online:
